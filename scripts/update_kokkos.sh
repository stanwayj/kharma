# This is for users of newer hardware who wish to use newer Kokkos versions.
# Specifically, Kokkos 4.7, which is the last compatible version with this
# parthenon/KHARMA codebase.
# Version 4.7 is not the default due to issues with some MPI implementations
# hanging at the end of simulations. Most large-scale clusters do not
# have this problem, but you should test for it if upgrading.

# The next version of KHARMA will use a much newer Parthenon version and fix
# this properly, I swear
